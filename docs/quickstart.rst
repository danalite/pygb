This is a quickstart reference to using PyGB. PyGB is cross-platform GUI automation module that works on Python 2 & 3. You can control the mouse and keyboard as well as perform basic image recognition to automate tasks on your computer.

**All the keyword arguments in the examples on this page are optional.**

    >>> import pygb

PyGB works on Windows/Mac/Linux and on Python 2 & 3. Install from PyPI with `pip install pygb`.

General Functions
-----------------

    >>> pygb.position()  # current mouse x and y
    (968, 56)
    >>> pygb.size()  # current screen resolution width and height
    (1920, 1080)
    >>> pygb.onScreen(x, y)  # True if x & y are within the screen.
    True

Fail-Safes
----------

Set up a 2.5 second pause after each PyGB call:

    >>> import pygb
    >>> pygb.PAUSE = 2.5

When fail-safe mode is `True`, moving the mouse to the upper-left will raise a `pygb.FailSafeException` that can abort your program:

    >>> import pygb
    >>> pygb.FAILSAFE = True

Mouse Functions
---------------

XY coordinates have 0, 0 origin at top left corner of the screen. X increases going right, Y increases going down.

    >>> pygb.moveTo(x, y, duration=num_seconds)  # move mouse to XY coordinates over num_second seconds
    >>> pygb.moveRel(xOffset, yOffset, duration=num_seconds)  # move mouse relative to its current position

If `duration` is 0 or unspecified, movement is immediate. Note: dragging on Mac can't be immediate.

    >>> pygb.dragTo(x, y, duration=num_seconds)  # drag mouse to XY
    >>> pygb.dragRel(xOffset, yOffset, duration=num_seconds)  # drag mouse relative to its current position

Calling `click()` just clicks the mouse once with the left button at the mouse's current location, but the keyword arguments can change that:

    >>> pygb.click(x=moveToX, y=moveToY, clicks=num_of_clicks, interval=secs_between_clicks, button='left')

The `button` keyword argument can be `'left'`, `'middle'`, or `'right'`.

All clicks can be done with `click()`, but these functions exist for readability. Keyword args are optional:

    >>> pygb.rightClick(x=moveToX, y=moveToY)
    >>> pygb.middleClick(x=moveToX, y=moveToY)
    >>> pygb.doubleClick(x=moveToX, y=moveToY)
    >>> pygb.tripleClick(x=moveToX, y=moveToY)

Positive scrolling will scroll up, negative scrolling will scroll down:

    >>> pygb.scroll(amount_to_scroll, x=moveToX, y=moveToY)

Individual button down and up events can be called separately:

    >>> pygb.mouseDown(x=moveToX, y=moveToY, button='left')
    >>> pygb.mouseUp(x=moveToX, y=moveToY, button='left')

Keyboard Functions
------------------

Key presses go to wherever the keyboard cursor is at function-calling time.

    >>> pygb.typewrite('Hello world!\n', interval=secs_between_keys)  # useful for entering text, newline is Enter

A list of key names can be passed too:

    >>> pygb.typewrite(['a', 'b', 'c', 'left', 'backspace', 'enter', 'f1'], interval=secs_between_keys)

The full list of key names is in `pygb.KEYBOARD_KEYS`.

Keyboard hotkeys like Ctrl-S or Ctrl-Shift-1 can be done by passing a list of key names to `hotkey()`:

    >>> pygb.hotkey('ctrl', 'c')  # ctrl-c to copy
    >>> pygb.hotkey('ctrl', 'v')  # ctrl-v to paste

Individual button down and up events can be called separately:

    >>> pygb.keyDown(key_name)
    >>> pygb.keyUp(key_name)


Screenshot Functions
--------------------

PyGB uses Pillow/PIL for its image-related data.

On Linux, you must run `sudo apt-get install scrot` to use the screenshot features.

    >>> pygb.screenshot()  # returns a Pillow/PIL Image object
    <PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=1920x1080 at 0x24C3EF0>
    >>> pygb.screenshot('foo.png')  # returns a Pillow/PIL Image object, and saves it to a file
    <PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=1920x1080 at 0x31AA198>

If you have an image file of something you want to click on, you can find it on the screen with `locateOnScreen()`.

    >>> pygb.locateOnScreen('looksLikeThis.png')  # returns (left, top, width, height) of first place it is found
    (863, 417, 70, 13)

The `locateAllOnScreen()` function will return a generator for all the locations it is found on the screen:

    >>> for i in pygb.locateAllOnScreen('looksLikeThis.png')
    ...
    ...
    (863, 117, 70, 13)
    (623, 137, 70, 13)
    (853, 577, 70, 13)
    (883, 617, 70, 13)
    (973, 657, 70, 13)
    (933, 877, 70, 13)

    >>> list(pygb.locateAllOnScreen('looksLikeThis.png'))
    [(863, 117, 70, 13), (623, 137, 70, 13), (853, 577, 70, 13), (883, 617, 70, 13), (973, 657, 70, 13), (933, 877, 70, 13)]

The `locateCenterOnScreen()` function just returns the XY coordinates of the middle of where the image is found on the screen:

    >>> pygb.locateCenterOnScreen('looksLikeThis.png')  # returns center x and y
    (898, 423)

These functions return `None` if the image couldn't be found on the screen.

Note: The locate functions are slow and can take a full second or two.
